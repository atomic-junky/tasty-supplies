## Cutting Board
!> The doc for the cutting board is in WIP!

You can use the **cutting board** to cut certain items. To do this, **right-click** on the cutting board to place the item you want to cut and **left-click** on the cutting board to cut the item. <br>
Only certain items, such as pies, can be cut, but all items can be placed on the cutting board. <br>
To remove an item from the cutting board, simply left-click any item except the knife on the cutting board. This also works when there are no items to break the cutting board. <br>
