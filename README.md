## Contribute
To contribute you'll need to use [beet](https://github.com/mcbeet/beet/tree/728859b2bf7b7725fcf7aa7de3788c668ffd668d).

First link beet to your dev world
```cmd
C:\> beet link <dev_world_name>
```

And second make beet watch all changes
```cmd
C:\> beet watch
```

Replace `beet` with `beet -p ./tasty_supplies/` if you want to stay in the root folder, else do `cd ./tasty_supplies/`.

Like that if you make any changes for the data pack just type `/reload` in minecraft and if you make in any chnages for the resource pack, disable and re-enable the resource pack.
